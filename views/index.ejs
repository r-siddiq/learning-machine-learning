            Machine Learning is the silent architect of a new intelligence, where patterns emerge from chaos and predictions arise 
            from dataâ€™s depths. It is not merely a tool but a mirror to human curiosity, reflecting our quest to teach machines what 
            we ourselves struggle to define: understanding. Rooted in mathematics and fueled by computation, it bridges the tangible 
            and the abstract, reshaping reality one algorithm at a time.

            <h2>Supervised Learning</h2>
            <p>
                Supervised learning algorithms train on labeled datasets to predict outcomes. Examples include linear regression, logistic 
                regression, and decision trees.
